	Problem Statement and Process Model 


Problem Statement:

The College Music Society lacks a centralized and dynamic online platform to effectively promote its activities, share information with members, and engage with the broader community. Currently, information dissemination relies heavily on traditional methods such as flyers and word-of-mouth, leading to limited reach and engagement. Additionally, the absence of a digital platform hampers the society's ability to showcase its events, achievements, and opportunities to both existing members and potential stakeholders.


This lack of an online presence not only diminishes the society's visibility and impact but also hinders its capacity to attract new members, sponsors, and collaborators. Moreover, without a dedicated platform, managing membership registration, event scheduling, and communication becomes cumbersome and inefficient.


In light of these challenges, there is a critical need to develop a comprehensive website for the College Music Society that serves as a central hub for all its activities, resources, and interactions. Such a platform would facilitate seamless communication, enhance member engagement, and elevate the society's profile within the college community and beyond.
